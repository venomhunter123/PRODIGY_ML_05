A model that can accurately recognize food items from the images and estimate their calories content, enabling users to track their dietary intake and make informed food calories.
A mixture of methods including canny edge detection, 
watershed segmentation, morphological operators and Otsuâ€™s 
method were used to segment the food item to obtain the 
contour of the food and the contour of the thumb. We use the 
thumb finger for calibration purposes. The thumb is placed 
next to the dish while clicking the photo and this thumb gives 
us the estimate of the real-life size of the food item and helps 
estimate volume accurately.
